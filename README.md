# AdlessSpotify

**Warning:** I highly recommend buying Spotify Premium in order to help support Spotify, but in case you're unable to do so, this script exists to help make life a bit easier.

This script disables and removes ads for the Windows desktop Spotify client. It does not affect the Microsoft Store version of Spotify, so if you have the Microsoft Store version of Spotify and would like to use this script, please uninstall it and install the desktop Spotify client.

**How to use this script:** click on the [releases](https://github.com/squishycat92/AdlessSpotify/releases/), download the `AdlessSpotify.ps1` script, save it somewhere that is easily accessible, right click it, and click "Run with Powershell." You can also run this script using different methods (using Windows Terminal or other similar method) if you'd prefer.

Special thanks to the [SpotifyHosts subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/spotifyhosts), the [BlockTheSpot project](https://github.com/mrpond/BlockTheSpot), and Light for figuring out custom program files and inspiring me to create this script!
